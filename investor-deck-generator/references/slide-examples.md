# Slide Content Examples

Reference examples for each Sequoia slide type. Adapt to your specific company.

## Slide 1: Title

**Minimal**:
```
COMPANY NAME
One-line that captures what you do
```

**With context**:
```
COMPANY NAME
The AI platform for [industry] [outcome]

Seed Round | January 2026
```

## Slide 2: Company Purpose

**Strong examples**:

> We enable every manufacturer to optimize production with AI, without data scientists.

> We make cross-border payments instant, transparent, and 90% cheaper.

> We turn enterprise data into actionable decisions in real-time.

**Weak examples** (avoid):

> We're building the future of technology.
> We help businesses succeed.
> We're a AI-powered platform.

**Formula**: We [action verb] [specific customer] to [achieve specific outcome] [optional: unique mechanism].

## Slide 3: Problem

**Example A - Enterprise SaaS**:
```
THE PROBLEM

• Manufacturers lose $50B annually to unplanned downtime
  - Equipment failures cause 82% of production stoppages
  - Current solutions detect issues only after failure occurs

• Maintenance teams are flying blind
  - Scattered sensor data across 15+ disconnected systems
  - No way to predict failures before they happen

• AI solutions exist but require PhD-level expertise
  - 6-12 month implementation cycles
  - $500K+ in data science talent required

"We spent $2M on sensors but still can't predict when machines will fail."
— VP Operations, Fortune 500 Manufacturer
```

**Example B - Consumer/SMB**:
```
THE PROBLEM

• Small businesses waste 15 hours/week on manual invoicing
  - 67% still use spreadsheets or paper
  - Average $4,200/year in late payment losses

• Existing solutions are built for enterprises
  - Complex setup requiring accounting expertise
  - Pricing starts at $200/month minimum

• Cash flow kills more small businesses than competition
  - 82% of failures cite cash flow as primary factor
```

## Slide 4: Solution

• Smart invoicing: AI writes and sends professional invoices
• Instant payments: Customers pay with one click
• Auto follow-up: Gentle reminders that actually work

Result: Customers get paid 14 days faster on average.
```

## Slide 5: Why Now

**Example - Manufacturing AI**:
```
WHY NOW?

1. SENSOR PROLIFERATION
   IoT sensors now cost $0.50 (down from $50 in 2015)
   Every machine generates continuous data streams

2. AI BREAKTHROUGH
   Foundation models enable training with 10x less data
   Real-time inference now possible at edge

3. LABOR SHORTAGE
   2.1M manufacturing jobs unfilled by 2030
   Companies must do more with fewer experts

→ The technology, economics, and market need have converged.
```

## Slide 6: Market Size

**Example A - Bottom-up**:
```
MARKET OPPORTUNITY

$85B                    $12B                    $1.2B
TAM                     SAM                     SOM

predictive              discrete                machines ready
maintenance             manufacturing           for AI maintenance

Growing 23% annually as AI adoption accelerates

Methodology: 45,000 target plants × $27K average ACV
```

**Example B - Top-down with wedge**:
```
MARKET OPPORTUNITY

$340B → $42B → $8B → $2B
Global Payments → Cross-border SMB → Underserved Markets → Year 3 Target

Our wedge: Latin America remittances—$150B market with 7% fees
```

## Slide 7: Competition

**2x2 Matrix Example**:
```
COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
