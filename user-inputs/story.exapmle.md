# Investor Deck Story Arc - ARC Example

This is an example story file for Autonomous Resource Corporation (ARC).

## Opening Hook

"America's industrial future depends on AI infrastructure we don't yet own."

## The Journey

### Act 1: The Problem

U.S. manufacturing has fallen behind while AI compute remains concentrated in closed, commercial clouds. Critical materials take 12+ months to qualify through traditional processes, and AI infrastructure costs 10x what it should for industrial applications.

### Act 2: The Solution

ARC builds open AI infrastructure paired with autonomous manufacturing loops. We compress materials qualification from 12 months to 4 months and deliver AI compute at 10x lower cost through purpose-built AI factories.

### Act 3: Why Now

Three forces are converging: DOE's Project Genesis is mobilizing federal resources for AI-enabled manufacturing, AI compute demand is doubling while infrastructure lags, and next-gen accelerators (NVIDIA Rubin) enable step-change economics.

### Act 4: The Opportunity

ARC becomes the national nervous system for industrial AI - federating compute, manufacturing equipment, and materials science into a unified platform for American industrial advantage.

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. Open architecture, model-agnostic - no vendor lock-in
2. AI-to-atom capability - from compute to qualified parts
3. National lab alignment - ORNL partnership under Genesis
4. 10x cost advantage through purpose-built infrastructure
5. Proven team with DARPA, Boeing, and Morgan Stanley pedigree

## Stories & Anecdotes to Include

- Desktop Metal acquisition (Sep 2025) as manufacturing foundation
- CM247 qualification results: 98.3-98.7% density, exceeds cast baseline
- Project Genesis announcement (Nov 25, 2025) as federal validation

## Things to Avoid

- Specific valuation discussions
- Detailed technical architecture diagrams
- Competitor criticism
- Unverified market size claims

## Target Audience

- Primary audience: Growth-stage infrastructure investors ($50-200M checks)
- Secondary audience: Strategic corporates (defense primes, energy majors)

## Desired Tone

Tone: Authoritative

## Call to Action
